iInject is a dependency injection library for javascript/node.js

Heavily ispired from Google's Guice project https://code.google.com/p/google-guice/


Why iInject?
===========

At work we have quite a big deployment of node.js applications and they depend heavily on internal services.
To solve the problem of testing and modularizing the code I wanted to use something like 'Google's Guice' for javascript, so ended up writing one :-)


There are some examples in the examples folder which shall hopefully help you on how to get started with. However I suggest to start off with watching this video:
